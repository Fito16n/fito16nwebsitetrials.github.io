			<p>As a Project Manager Intern at Dribbli, I worked on a team under the leadership of <a class="links" href="https://about.me/chechevidal">Juan Jose Vidal</a>, where we implemented Dribbli's pilot technology in the <a class="links" href="https://www.usacup.org/">USA Cup 2021</a>, the largest youth soccer tournament in North America. I managed the distribution of technology to <a class="links" href="https://www.nscsports.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAubmPBhCyARIsAJWNpiO0P8TayVoC93MakhxsgtQnJYosailFbqD_gyr4XlFBhb7n93dQIVUaAvNeEALw_wcB>USA Cup 2021">National Sports Center</a> 
			staff and volunteers, while also training them in the use of the Dribbli app and web service to manage the competions both synchronously in the field, and asynchronously for league management. To improve user experience, I also initiated daily surveying to use feedback from our app users and the public using our web services to then present to our software engineer and web developer, which resulted in increased approval of the app and website by our users.
